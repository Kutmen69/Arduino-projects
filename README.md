## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to Arduino enthusiasts who want to explore various projects ranging from beginner to advanced levels. Each project comes with its own set of instructions and code to help you understand and implement the concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, you'll need the following:

- An Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Mega, Nano, etc.)
- Arduino IDE installed on your computer
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming
- Various electronic components (specified in each project's README)

## Project List

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

1. **Blinking LED**
   - A simple project to get started with Arduino, where an LED blinks at regular intervals.
