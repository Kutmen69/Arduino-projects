## Project List

Here arethe projects included in this repository:
1️⃣ LED Blink – The most basic Arduino project! This makes an LED blink on and off every second using digitalWrite() and delay().

2️⃣ Button Controlled LED – Press a button, and the LED turns on. Release the button, and it turns off. Uses digitalRead() with INPUT_PULLUP.

3️⃣ Potentiometer Read – Reads values from a potentiometer (a variable resistor) and prints them to the Serial Monitor. Great for learning analog input.

4️⃣ LED Fade – Smoothly increases and decreases the brightness of an LED using analogWrite(), which controls PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).

5️⃣ Ultrasonic Distance Sensor – Uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance of objects and displays it in centimeters.

6️⃣ Collision Warner – A more advanced project that uses the ultrasonic sensor to detect nearby objects and trigger a warning (LEDs)


More projects will be added over time, so stay tuned!
